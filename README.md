4. "Deep Learning" course in Oxford university. Yes, it is about Machine Learning, but anyway he is about modern approaches in ML area. Added by @vladyslav_chikov

	* [Machine Learning: 2014-2015](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/) Slides + Videos

6. If you are interested in Neural Networks it exists a course from University of Toronto "Neural Networks for Machine Learning". It was run only once in 2012 but all materials available. The course is really complex and difficult, it covers a lot of topics and has a lot of supplementary reading, but after it you will be a pro in the world of NN. Added by @vladyslav_chikov

7. If you are interested in practical solutions, it exists a specialization on Coursera "Machine Learning" from University of Washington. They provide some theory but you will need a lot of Python practice also. Added by @vladyslav_chikov
